# Module-3-homework ( Password generator)

## Description

This is a password generator created with Javascript . It's designed to consolidate what was learned in module 3, and it serves as a way to create a safe password using user input as criteria for the characters used. The placeholder images are to be filled later on with actual projects made by the students.

## Overview

Click the Generate button
Choose the amount of characters you would like in you password
Answer the promps to choose what type of characters your password will have
The password will be shown. Copy it or write it down for later use.
Refresh the page if you need a new password, since the last password generated wont be deleted automatically.

There is an old code commented out in the Javascript file, it was lengthy and had lots of repetition but it was successful in deleting the old password automatically. I opted for the drier code so its easier to read and understand.
